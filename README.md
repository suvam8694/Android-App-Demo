# Android-App-Demo
A small project containing an Android Application for demonstration purposes.

Please Note:
1. The RecyclerView is updated automatically when the user scrolls down 70% of the time. In the remaining cases, the user is required to manually update by swiping up and automatic updation is suppressed until the user updates the view once manually. This is not a bug, the system has been implemented this way to demonstrate both automatic and manual updates.
2. The project uses SwipeRefreshLayoutBottom view and other supporting files for this view from a BitBucket repository which can be found at the link given below.
